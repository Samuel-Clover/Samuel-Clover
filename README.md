### Hi 👋
I'm just graduated in Computer Technician and I'm studying systems analysis and development and I'm looking for opportunities and collaboration in projects related to website and application development..
- 🔭 Always looking for the next level for evolution.
- 🌱 I always try to find mistakes and fix them as quickly as possible.
- 🤝 I'm currently learning Frameworks to save time for other projects..
